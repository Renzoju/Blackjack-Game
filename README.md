# Blackjack Game 🎲🃏  

This is a simple **Blackjack** game I built for a school project.  
I've always found Blackjack to be an exciting and strategic card game, so I decided to create my own version.  

## 🃠 About the Game  
The game follows classic Blackjack rules:  
- Try to get as close to **21** as possible without going over.  
- Face off against the **dealer**, who follows set rules for drawing cards.  
- Use strategy to decide whether to **hit** or **stand**.  

## 🎯 Why I Built This  
This project was a great opportunity to improve my programming skills, especially in handling game logic and user interaction.  
I also wanted to learn more about how card games are structured in code.  

## 🚀 Try It Out  
Clone the repository and run the game yourself! Feedback and contributions are always welcome.
